# ez-marking

A simple app to mark attendance and see which students were absent. Tap each student to mark as present, then click submit when finished. To see history, click the clock icon then choose a date and time. New students can be imported from the import section: first select a list of names and filenames, then select the corresponding images.
The interface shows Hebrew names by default if available.

[Supabase](https://supabase.io) is used as the database and for user authentication. The images are stored in [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com).
